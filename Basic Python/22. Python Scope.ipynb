    "# Python Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the term \"scope\" refers to the region of the program where a variable or function is defined and can be accessed. The scope of a variable or function determines where in the program it can be used, and whether it can be accessed by other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has two main types of scopes: global scope and local scope. Global scope refers to the region of the program where a variable or function is defined at the top level of the module. Global variables and functions can be accessed from anywhere within the module. On the other hand, local scope refers to the region of the program where a variable or function is defined inside a function or block of code. Local variables and functions can only be accessed within the function or block of code where they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has the concept of nested scopes, where a function can access variables from the scope in which it was defined as well as from the global scope. However, the global variables can only be accessed inside a function using the global keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the concept of scope in Python because it can help prevent naming conflicts and make your code more organized and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
